# Public Transport Data Engineering Pipeline
# 🚧 Work in progress — building a public transit data engineering pipeline

End-to-end ETL pipeline that ingests GTFS transit data (Berlin & Paris),
builds a data warehouse, computes KPIs, and orchestrates daily runs using Apache Airflow.

## Stack
Python, Pandas, MySQL, SQL, Airflow

## Pipeline
GTFS -> Staging -> Cleaning -> Fact Table -> Aggregates -> Analytics Mart

## Goal
Simulate a production-style batch data engineering workflow.
